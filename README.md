## What is Arcademia?
Arcademia is the name we use to refer to the University of Lincoln's Arcade project. The project is a collection of games developed by students and staff at the University of Lincoln. These games are then showcased in the university's arcade machines for everyone to play.

## How to get started?
To get started with the development of Arcademia is very simple. All you need to do is to create a game that fits the [Control Scheme](Controls) of the arcade machine.

Once you have your game ready, you can [Submit Your Game](Submission) to the project. Your game will then be reviewed by the team and, if approved, it will be added to the arcade machines.
